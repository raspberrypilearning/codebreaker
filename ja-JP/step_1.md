## You will make

Analyse a graph to crack the code, whilst learning about lists and functions.

You will:
+ Define a function that takes parameters and returns a value
+ Use `while` and `for` loops to repeat tasks
+ Create a chart to display frequency data

### Play ▶️

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  

This program can **encode** or **decode** a secret message from an attached `.txt` file, or it can **analyse the frequency** of letters in a message. This data will be displayed in a frequency graph, which shows how often each letter appears in the secret message.

Run the program twice to explore how it works: 
+ First, choose 'c' to decode a message stored in an attached `.txt` file 
+ Then, run the program a second time and choose 'f' at the prompt; this will display a letter frequency graph for the message.

The <span style="color: #0faeb0">Atbash</span> cypher is one of the world's oldest known cyphers (a cypher is a secret or disguised way of writing). Originally developed in the <span style="color: #0faeb0">Hebrew</span> language, it takes the alphabet and matches it to its reverse order to create a secret message. The name derives from the first, last, second, and second-last Hebrew letters: <span style="color: #0faeb0">Aleph, Taw, Bet,</span> and <span style="color: #0faeb0">Shin.</span></p>
