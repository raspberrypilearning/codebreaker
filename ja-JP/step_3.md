## Encode a message

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step, you will create a function that can take your text, flip it and reverse it with your atbash cypher list, and return it as an encoded message.

**Comment out** the print statement used for testing on line 17 by placing a hashtag at the beginning of the line:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - create_code() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 14
line_highlights: 17
---
  for i in range(len(alphabet)): # Gets length of a list code[alphabet[i]] = backwards[i] # Populates the code dictionary with a letter of the alphabet and its encoded letter

# print(code)
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

### Set up your atbash function

You will now add your new **function** that will encode some text using the **atbash** cypher.

--- task ---

Find the comment that says `# Encode/decode a piece of text — atbash is symmetrical`. Underneath the comment, define a function called `atbash`, with the **parameter** `text`. Parameters allow you to pass values into functions that can be used within that function.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - atbash() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 26
line_highlights: 27
---
# Encode/decode a piece of text — atbash is symmetrical
def atbash(text):

--- /code ---

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should see the next line indented.

--- /task ---

[[[parameters]]]

### Convert text to lower case

First your function needs to convert the `text` to lower case. A new **variable** called `output` then needs to be created to hold the encoded message.

--- task ---

 Beneath the line of code where you have defined the `atbash()` function, type:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - atbash() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 27
line_highlights: 29-30
---
# Encode/decode a piece of text — atbash is symmetrical
def atbash(text): text = text.lower() # Converts text to lower case output = ''

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

### Encode your text

The next part of your code will **encode** the `text` that has been **passed** into the function. A `for` loop is used to go through each letter in the `text` and convert it to an encoded letter using the `code` dictionary. Finally, it will **return** the encoded message.

--- task ---

Leave a blank line under the last code you entered (make sure you keep the indent), then type:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - atbash() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 28
line_highlights: 33-37
---
# Encode/decode a piece of text — atbash is symmetrical
def atbash(text): text = text.lower() # Converts text to lower case output = ''

  for letter in text: if letter in code: output += code[letter] # Populates output with the encoded/decoded message using the dictionary

  return output # Return the encoded/decoded message

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

### Test and debug

--- task ---

Now that you have a **function** that will **encode text**, you need to run it to make sure it works. Find your `main()` function and add in a function call to run the `atbash()` function.

The 'Test' string is **passed** into the function so that it can be encoded.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - main() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 48
line_highlights: 51
---
# Start up
def main(): create_code() print(atbash('Test'))

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code to see if the test message displays correctly. You should see the console output `gvhg`.

**Debug:** If you see a message about an indentation error:
- Check that you have indented all of your code correctly
- Look back at the sample code on this page to help you check

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Comment out** your `print(atbash('Test'))` line of code now that you have finished testing.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - main() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 48
line_highlights: 51
---
# Start up
def main(): create_code() #print(atbash('Test'))

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

In the next step you will **encode** a message with the help of your `code` dictionary.
