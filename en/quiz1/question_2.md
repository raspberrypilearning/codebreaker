A `for` loop is created to display the letters in a word. 

```python
word = "hello"

for letter in word:
    print(letter)
```

What will be the output of this code when it is run?

```

  Correct! Each letter of the word `hello` will be displayed on a new line. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 
```
w
o
r
d
```
  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, `print(letter)` will display what is **held** by the variable `letter` at that point in the `for` loop. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 

```
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
```

  --- feedback ---

  Not exactly, the code will print each letter in `hello`. It will not print the whole word each time.
