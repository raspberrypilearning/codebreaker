legend: Question 1 of 3

A **function** called `add()` has been created to perform a calculation on two numbers and **return** the result. What will be displayed as output on the screen when this code is run?

```python

def add(one, two):
    result = one + two
    
    return result

print(add(5, 10))

```

- ( )

`add(5, 10)`

  --- feedback ---

This is the **function call**. This calls the `add()` function and passes the numbers `5` and `10` as arguments. These numbers are then used by the function.  

  --- /feedback ---

- ( )

`one + two`

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, the function will **return** the result of adding the values held in the variables `one` and `two` together.

- (x) 

`15`

  --- feedback ---

  Correct! The values `5` and `10` are passed into the function. They are then added together and held in the variable `result`. This is then **returned** and displayed as output using the `print()` function. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 

`result`

  --- feedback ---

  Almost, the output will display the value **held** by the `result` variable.
