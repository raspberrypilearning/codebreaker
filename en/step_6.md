In all languages, each letter in its alphabet has a 'personality' or set of traits when used in that language. One of the most obvious traits a letter has in any language is how often it appears.  **Frequency analysis** is the method of breaking codes by looking at how often letters are used in the language of the code, and comparing that to how often encoded letters show up in a message. In English, the letter **E** is the most commonly used letter (it shows up 12.8% of the time), followed by **T** (at 9.1%). The least often used letter is **Z**.

The `print(message_freq)` line of code on line 92 is no longer needed. Add a `#` to the beginning of it so that Python ignores it when the code is run.

  elif choice == 'f':
    print('Analysing messageâ€¦')
    message = get_text('input.txt') # Take input from the same file. We have a 'longer.txt' or similar containing cyphertext we know to perform reasonably well for frequency analysis
    message_freq = frequency(message) # Get the frequency of the letters in the message, as %
    # print(message_freq)

Find the `# Make frequency chart` comment on line 45 and create a new function called `make_chart()`. This function needs two parameters called `text` and `language`. The frequency chart will be a **bar** chart and the **title** is `Frequency analysis`.
