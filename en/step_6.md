Intro concepts of frequency analysis as a counter to encryption
Create the frequency function which accepts a string parameter and returns a dict of frequencies of letters in that string. 
Chart the frequency of the message against the frequency of the language itâ€™s in using pygal.

In all languages, each letter in its alphabet has a 'personality' or set of traits when used in that language. One of the most obvious traits a letter has in any language is how often it appears.  **Frequency analysis** is the method of breaking codes by looking at how often letters are used in the language of the code, and comparing that to how often encoded letters show up in a message. In English, the letter **E** is the most commonly used letter (it shows up 12.8% of the time), followed by **T** (at 9.1%). The least often used letter is **Z**.
