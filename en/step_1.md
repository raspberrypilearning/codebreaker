## Introduction

Analyse a frequency graph to crack the code, whilst learning about lists and functions.

The <span style="color: #0faeb0">Atbash</span> cypher is one of the world's oldest known cyphers. Originally developed in the <span style="color: #0faeb0">Hebrew</span> language, it takes the alphabet and matches it to it's reverse in order to create a secret message. he name derives from the first, last, second, and second-last Hebrew letters: <span style="color: #0faeb0">Aleph, Taw, Bet </span> and <span style="color: #0faeb0">Shin</span></p>

You will:
+ Define a function that takes parameters and returns a value
+ Use a `while` loop to repeat tasks 
+ Create a chart to display frequency data

Run the program to either encrypt or decrypt the text stored in the <kbd>input.txt</kbd> file. You can also analyse the frequency of letters in the message:
